# Leo's Music Shop API in Java (Spring Boot)
This is another very cool API for Leo's Music Shop.

For now this API only sells drum kits.

## Motivation

I wanted to learn how Segment SDK in Java behaves in a Spring Boot application.

This is used to validate Segment application onboarding using Java/Spring Boot archetype. I believe it can be used for Groovy and Kotlin as well.
